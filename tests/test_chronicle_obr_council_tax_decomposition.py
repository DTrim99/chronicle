"""OBR EFO March 2026 Table 4.1 council tax block, carried in full.

Row 19 'Total net council tax receipts' (concept obr.council_tax_total) equals
row 15 'Total council tax receipts' (England + Scotland + Wales) plus NI
domestic rates, the council tax accruals adjustment and, from 2028-29, the
high-value council tax surcharge. The decomposition rows let a consumer bind a
household council tax liability to the GB cash-receipts total instead of the
UK total that carries components with no household counterpart.
